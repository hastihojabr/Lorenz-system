# Lorenz-system

The Lorenz system is a system of ordinary differential equations. Edward Lorenz found out that theses equations have chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions. The Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system.

### Solution
We solved these equations using for these initial conditions..
inital_conditions = [0.5,0.51,0.5]   # x_0, y_0, z_0
sigma,r,b = 10, 28, 8/3

### Butterfly effect
Because of the shape of the plot, Butterfly effect is associated with The Lorenz attractor.
